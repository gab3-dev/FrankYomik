# Frank Yomik

Read Japanese and Korean comics — Japanese novels too — in the original, and look up only what you stumble on. Frank Yomik translates manga and webtoons or adds furigana, and now includes a PDF study reader with tap-to-look-up text and kanji. OCR and document extraction run on your own server; PDF reading and dictionary lookup stay on the device.

## Hold to peek

The page is left exactly as the publisher drew it. Press and hold for 200ms and
a magnifier opens under your pointer, showing the same page with the
translation or the readings — release and it is gone. A quick tap still turns
the page, so the reader underneath keeps working as it always did.

<table>
<tr>
<td width="50%" align="center">
<a href="docs/media/lens-manga.mp4"><img src="docs/media/lens-manga-poster.jpg" width="100%" alt="Peeking at a manga speech balloon through the lens"></a>
<em>Manga: furigana over a balloon, 1.5x / 2x / 3x.<br><a href="docs/media/lens-manga.mp4">▶ play (20s)</a></em>
</td>

</td>
</tr>
</table>

Full-page replacement is still there as a mode, in both the app and the
extension, for when you would rather read the translation outright.

While a page is being translated, a small dot in the corner says where it is —
amber while it works, green once it can be peeked, red if it could not be
translated — with a few words on each change. Holding before a translation
arrives shows the magnifier as an empty ring rather than nothing, so waiting is
distinguishable from broken.

## Components

| Directory | Language | Description |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| `server/` | Go + Python | API server, image pipelines, study-PDF extraction/OCR workers |
| `client/` | Dart/Flutter | Android + Linux reader app, WebView readers, local PDF study library |
| `extension/` | JavaScript | Chromium MV3 extension for desktop Kindle/Naver reading |
| `docs/` | — | Test images, screenshots, demo videos (Git LFS), deployment notes |

## How It Works

**Manga pipeline** (Japanese → English or furigana):
```
Image → RT-DETR-v2 bubble detection → manga-ocr → Ollama translation → English render
                                                 → MeCab furigana    → Vertical JP render
```

**Text book pipeline** (Japanese novels → furigana):
```
Image → column detection (projection profile) → manga-ocr per ~12 glyphs
      → MeCab readings over the whole column  → furigana drawn in the gutters
```

Kindle rasterises reflowable novels the same way it renders manga — one image
per page, no text in the DOM — so a book is annotated as pixels too. What makes
prose tractable is its regularity: a page gives ~29 evenly spaced columns, and
a page that does not look like typeset prose is refused rather than annotated
as if it were.

**Webtoon pipeline** (Korean → English):
```
Image → EasyOCR text detection → cluster into bubbles → Ollama translation → color-aware render
```

**Web service**: Go API accepts images over HTTP, deduplicates via SHA256, queues through Redis Streams with priority ordering. Python workers process jobs and push results via Redis Pub/Sub + WebSocket.

**Japanese study reader**: Import a PDF into the Flutter app. It keeps the
original locally and uploads one temporary copy to the configured Frank Yomik
server. The worker extracts character boxes from embedded PDF text or runs
Japanese OCR for scanned pages. The page currently being read is high priority;
other pages are processed in the background. The worker also attaches UniDic
word lemmas/readings to the positioned text. It removes the uploaded PDF after
page processing, while the app stores page layouts and reading progress locally.
Tap a character to look up its containing word and kanji in the on-device
SQLite dictionary. The dictionary is installed from the
English-common JMdict and English KANJIDIC2 distributions; see
`client/lib/services/local_japanese_dictionary.dart` for source attribution.
JMdict remains under the [EDRDG license](https://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html);
KANJIDIC2 is [CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

The protected debug API can also store original/translated page pairs uploaded from the Chromium extension. List recent pairs with `GET /api/v1/debug/pages`.

**Flutter client**: Wraps Kindle (read.amazon.co.jp) and Naver Webtoon in a WebView, captures pages, submits them to the API, and reveals translations through a magnifier lens. It also has a separate local PDF study library, searchable-text and scan support, and an offline dictionary lookup sheet. Existing site-reader translation modes remain available. The Chromium extension continues to present translations the same way as the app.

**Chromium extension**: Runs on desktop Chrome/Chromium, Brave, and Edge. It keeps Kindle and Naver pages visually close to stock: the content script detects the current page image, sends it to your self-hosted server, and reveals the result through the same hold-to-peek magnifier. All settings live in the extension popup; the bearer token stays in the extension service worker and is never exposed to page scripts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with `qwen3:14b` (~9 GB VRAM)
- Go 1.25+
- Redis
- Flutter 3.11+ (for the client app)

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankYomik.git
cd FrankYomik/server

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

ollama pull qwen3:14b
```

## CLI Usage

Run from `server/`:

```bash
# Manga: add furigana readings
python process_manga.py furigana

# Manga: translate to English
python process_manga.py translate

# Both + debug bounding boxes
python process_manga.py all --debug

# Webtoon: download and translate a Naver Webtoon chapter
python process_webtoon.py pipeline <URL>
```

Input: `docs/adult*.png` (furigana), `docs/shounen*.png` (translation).
Output: `output/furigana/`, `output/translate/`.

## Web Service

### Local

```bash
# Terminal 1
redis-server

# Terminal 2
cd server && AUTH_TOKEN=secret go run .

# Terminal 3
cd server && python -m worker --pipeline both
```

### Docker Compose

```bash
# Set auth token
echo "AUTH_TOKEN=mysecret" > .env

# Optionally set UID/GID to match your host user (default 1026)
echo "APP_UID=$(id -u)" >> .env
echo "APP_GID=$(id -g)" >> .env

# Build and start
docker compose up -d

# Check status
docker compose logs -f worker
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mysecret" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health
```

### Submit a Job

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer secret" \
  -F "image=@docs/shounen.png" \
  -F "pipeline=manga_translate" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs

# Poll status
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/<job_id>

# Download result
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer secret" http://localhost:8080/api/v1/jobs/<job_id>/image -o result.png
```

### Study a PDF

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer secret" \
  -F "document=@my-japanese-book.pdf" \
  -F "priority_page=1" \
  http://localhost:8080/api/v1/study/documents
```

The response includes a `document_id`. The client uses it to fetch each page's
OCR/text layout and to promote the page currently being read to high priority.
The original PDF is staged only until page processing finishes, then removed.

## API

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/jobs` | Upload image, returns `job_id` |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/:id` | Poll job status and metadata |
| GET | `/api/v1/jobs/:id/image` | Download processed image |
| DELETE | `/api/v1/jobs/:id` | Cancel/delete a job |
| POST | `/api/v1/study/documents` | Upload a PDF for temporary text extraction/OCR |
| GET | `/api/v1/study/documents/:id` | Read study-document processing status |
| GET | `/api/v1/study/documents/:id/pages/:page` | Fetch a page's text and normalized glyph coordinates |
| POST | `/api/v1/study/documents/:id/pages/:page/prioritize` | Prioritize the page currently being read |
| GET | `/api/v1/health` | Server + worker + queue status |
| WS | `/api/v1/ws` | Real-time result push |

All endpoints except `/health` require `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

Study uploads default to a 100 MiB maximum (`STUDY_PDF_MAX_SIZE_MB`). The
temporary PDF is removed after every page task finishes, or after a worker
failure; startup cleanup removes staged PDFs left behind for more than seven
days. Page layouts are transient Redis delivery data (24-hour TTL), and the
Flutter app caches layouts locally.

Pipelines: `manga_translate`, `manga_furigana`, `book_furigana`, `webtoon`. Priority: `high` (default) or `low` (prefetch).

## Cloudflare Tunnel (Remote Access)

Expose the API over HTTPS via [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) so the Flutter client can reach it from anywhere.

### One-time setup

```bash
# Install cloudflared
# Arch: pacman -S cloudflared
# Debian/Ubuntu: see https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/downloads/

# Authenticate with Cloudflare (opens browser)
cloudflared tunnel login

# Create a tunnel
cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel-name>

# Route DNS (requires a domain managed by Cloudflare)
cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel-name> <your-hostname>
```

### Configure

Create `.cloudflared/config.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
tunnel: <TUNNEL_UUID>
credentials-file: /etc/cloudflared/<TUNNEL_UUID>.json

ingress:
  - hostname: <your-hostname>
    service: http://api:8080
  - service: http_status:404
```

Copy your tunnel credentials JSON from `~/.cloudflared/<TUNNEL_UUID>.json` into `.cloudflared/`.

### Run with Docker Compose

The `docker-compose.yml` includes `init-cloudflared` and `cloudflared` services. The init container copies credentials from `.cloudflared/` into a Docker volume (avoids filesystem permission issues with NFS or restrictive mounts), then cloudflared connects the tunnel.

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The API is now reachable at `https://<your-hostname>`. Configure this URL in the Flutter client's Settings screen.

## Flutter Client

```bash
cd client
flutter pub get
flutter run -d linux       # Desktop
flutter run -d <device>    # Android

# Build release APK
flutter build apk --release
```

The client defaults to `http://localhost:8080`. Configure the server URL and auth token in the Settings screen.

## Chromium Extension

The desktop extension is the lightest way to use Frank Yomik directly on the Kindle Japan reader and Naver Webtoon sites. It supports:

- Kindle Japan: `read.amazon.co.jp`, `read.kindle.co.jp`
- Naver Webtoon: `comic.naver.com`, `m.comic.naver.com`
- Kindle pipelines: English translation, furigana, or furigana for text books
- Webtoon pipeline: Korean → English
- A pipeline per volume: a novel and a manga each keep their own, so switching books changes nothing
- Reading mode (lens or full page) and lens magnification
- Per-site enable/disable, target-language selection, and webtoon prefetch settings
- Manual force-reprocess and original-vs-translated debug pair upload from the popup

Debug uploads are stored server-side and can be listed with `GET /api/v1/debug/pages`.

### Manual install from a GitHub release

The extension is distributed as a zip asset on the [latest release](https://github.com/akitaonrails/FrankYomik/releases/latest). Chromium does not install this zip directly; load the extracted folder as an unpacked extension:

1. Download `frank-yomik-extension-*.zip` from the latest release assets.
2. Unzip it into a permanent folder, for example `~/Applications/frank-yomik-extension/`. Do not delete this folder after loading it.
3. Open your browser's extension page:
   - Chrome/Chromium/Brave: `chrome://extensions`
   - Edge: `edge://extensions`
4. Enable **Developer mode**.
5. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extracted folder that contains `manifest.json`.
6. Pin/open the **Frank Yomik** extension action.
7. Set the API base URL, auth token, sites, Kindle pipeline, and target language. Settings autosave when you leave a field; **Save now** is available as a fallback and may trigger the exact API-origin permission prompt.
8. Click **Check server**.
9. Reload any Kindle/Naver tabs that were already open.

To update, download the newer release zip, replace the extracted folder contents, then click the reload button on the extension card in `chrome://extensions`. If you remove and re-add the extension, export settings first because Chromium may clear extension storage.

### Versioning

The Android `versionCode` is derived from `git rev-list --count HEAD` (in `build.gradle.kts`), so every commit automatically produces a higher build number. You only need to bump the display version (`version: X.Y.Z` in `pubspec.yaml`) for releases — the build number takes care of itself.

### Android Sideloading

The APK is distributed directly (not via Google Play) because the app requires a locally-running server with GPU access — it's not a standalone app. To install on Android:

1. Transfer the APK to your phone
2. Enable **Install from unknown sources** for your file manager (Settings → Apps → Special access → Install unknown apps)
3. On Samsung devices, also disable **Auto Blocker** (Settings → Security → Auto Blocker)

This is a one-time setup. Future updates signed with the same key install without prompts.

## Testing

```bash
cd server

# Python unit tests (444 tests)
.venv/bin/pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Python integration tests (34 tests, needs test images in docs/)
.venv/bin/pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Go API tests (needs Redis for full coverage, skips gracefully without it)
go test -v .

# Flutter tests (82 tests; the lens suite needs node)
cd ../client && flutter test

# Chromium extension (134 unit + 14 browser tests, plus manifest validation)
cd ../extension && npm test
```

The extension's browser tests drive a real headless Chromium over the DevTools
protocol — no dependencies, and skipped automatically where no Chromium is
installed. They cover the things a DOM stub cannot judge: whether the reader's
own handlers still fire during a peek, whether a page and its translation are
recognised as the same page once reduced to a signature, and whether the status
indicator can actually be seen.

## Configuration

All settings in `server/config.yaml`:

| Section | Controls |
|---------|----------|
| `ollama` | Model, URL, temperature, think mode |
| `fonts` | Japanese, English, SFX font paths |
| `ocr` | Device (cpu/cuda) for manga-ocr |
| `text_detection` | EasyOCR confidence and GPU for artwork text |
| `manga_inpainting` | LaMa text removal (off by default) |
| `book` | Text-book render scale and OCR chunk size |
| `webtoon` | Scraper, OCR, bubble detection, inpainting |
| `worker` | Redis, consumer group, heartbeat, timeout |
